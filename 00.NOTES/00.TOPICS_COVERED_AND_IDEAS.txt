IDEAS:
-----
Timeouts - TODO


TOPICS COVERED:
--------------
Browser Context
Timeouts
TEXT EXTRACTION
WaitFor, waitForTimeout, waitForLoadState
Dropdowns
page.pause() and playwright inspector
Radio buttons and checkboxes
To validate any blinking element, just assert on the class or style that gives it this behaviour
Alert
Confirm
Prompt
Auth handling
modals
new tab/page
child tab/popup, window

reading <input> and <textarea> text, since they are written after DOM is attached/displayed in inspect, hence
not captured via textContent(), innerText()

Multiple locators handling
Keyboard delay so that we can assert on autosuggestion dropdowns
