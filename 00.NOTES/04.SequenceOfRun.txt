when we run npx playwright test,

playwright blindly runs all the specs under testDir in config.ts file

specs inside directories are run in parallel

test()s inside each spec are run in a sequence

NOTE:

Parallel unit   → spec files
Sequential unit → tests inside a spec file
Directories     → ignored for execution order


Directories don’t matter. Files do.

What actually runs in parallel?

Playwright Test runs test files (specs) in parallel, not directories.

    Given this structure lets say:

    Directory-1/
    ├── spec1.spec.ts
    └── spec2.spec.ts

    Directory-2/
    ├── spec3.spec.ts
    └── spec4.spec.ts

Default behavior (workers > 1)

spec1, spec2, spec3, and spec4 are all independent test files
Any of them can run in parallel, regardless of directory
Assignment to workers is based on availability, not directory grouping

So:
    ❌ Directory-1 does not run as a unit
    ❌ spec1 and spec2 are not guaranteed to be sequential
    ✅ Any spec can run in parallel with any other spec

What is guaranteed to be sequential?
    ✔ test() blocks inside the same spec file run sequentially
    ✔ Tests inside test.describe.serial() run sequentially

Example:

test.describe.serial('serial block', () => {
  test('A', async () => {});
  test('B', async () => {});
});

How to make behavior match your assumption
1️⃣ Force everything in a directory to be sequential

Use one worker:

// playwright.config.ts
workers: 1

2️⃣ Make a specific file run serially
test.describe.serial(...)
