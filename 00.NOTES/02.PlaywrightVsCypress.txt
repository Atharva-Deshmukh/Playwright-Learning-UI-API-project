                            1️⃣ Reliable End-to-End Testing (Auto-wait & Stability)
                            ------------------------------------------------------

Playwright has built-in auto-waiting for everything:

element to appear
element to be visible
element to be enabled
network to be idle
animations to finish

await page.click('#submit');
await page.waitForURL('/dashboard');


No manual waits needed — Playwright automatically waits until:

#submit is attached, visible, clickable
navigation fully completes

                                        Cypress comparison

cy.get('#submit').click()
cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard')


Cypress retries assertions, not actions

If app has complex async behavior, you often need:

cy.wait(2000) // flaky but common

Why Playwright is more stable

✔ Playwright controls the browser at the protocol level
✔ Cypress runs inside the browser event loop

Result:

Playwright handles race conditions better
Fewer flaky tests in large, dynamic apps

                                    2️⃣ Cross-Browser Compatibility
                                    ------------------------------

Playwright supports real browser engines:
    Chromium (Chrome, Edge)
    Firefox
    WebKit (Safari engine)


Cypress mainly supports: Chromium browsers

Why Cypress can’t control multiple browsers at once?
---------------------------------------------------

Basically, in cypress your test code and your application code:
    run in the same JS thread
    share the same event loop

Each browser has:
    its own JS engine
    its own event loop
    its own memory space

Since Cypress test code lives inside one browser:
It can only control that single browser instance


Why Cypress can’t do multi-tab?
------------------------------

Tabs are:
    separate browsing contexts
    separate JS worlds
    separate event loops
    Cypress injects itself into one tab only.

When your app opens a new tab -> window.open('/new-page')

Cypress:
    loses control
    cannot inject itself into the new tab


What Cypress does instead
    cy.stub(window, 'open')
    👉 Which means you are no longer testing real behavior.

Playwright contrast --> Playwright controls tabs at the browser protocol level:

const [newPage] = await Promise.all([
  context.waitForEvent('page'),
  page.click('#open-tab')
]);


This is impossible in Cypress because of event loop isolation.


                                    Native OS-Level Interaction
                                    ---------------------------

Playwright can:
    Handle file chooser dialogs
    Capture downloads
    Control permissions
    Handle clipboard
    Work with native auth dialogs

    const [download] = await Promise.all([
    page.waitForEvent('download'),
    page.click('#export')
    ]);

    await download.saveAs('report.pdf');

Cypress
    ❌ No native download control
    ❌ No OS dialogs
    ⚠️ Uses DOM shortcuts instead


                            Network Control at Protocol Level
                            ---------------------------------

Playwright
    Intercept
    Modify
    Mock
    Continue
    Abort
    Inspect response bodies

    await page.route('/api/user', route =>
    route.fulfill({
        status: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'Mock User' })
    })
    );

Cypress

    Can stub requests
    ❌ Cannot modify low-level browser behavior
    ❌ Cannot observe raw browser protocol traffic


                                    3️⃣ Multiplatform Support (OS & Devices)
                                    ---------------------------------------

Playwright strengths

    Windows, macOS, Linux
    Mobile emulation (Chrome Android, Safari iOS)
    Multiple browser contexts (isolated sessions)

    const context = await browser.newContext({
    viewport: { width: 375, height: 812 },
    userAgent: 'iPhone'
    });

Cypress limitations
    No true browser contexts and multi user parallel sessions login


What counts as OS-level?
-----------------------

File chooser dialogs
    Native alerts
    Downloads
    Clipboard
    Permissions
    Multiple windows
    System authentication popups

Cypress limitation

Because Cypress runs inside the browser sandbox:
    It cannot access OS APIs
    It cannot intercept native dialogs
    It cannot observe real file downloads

Why cy.task() cannot fix this?
------------------------------

It runs in a separate Node process

❌ cy.task() cannot:
    control another browser
    open a new tab
    interact with native dialogs
    intercept browser events
    synchronize with browser rendering

Because:
It cannot inject JS into other contexts
It cannot pause or control browser execution

cy.task() is a helper, not a browser controller


                                    4️⃣ Multilingual Flexibility
                                    ---------------------------

Playwright Supports:
    JavaScript / TypeScript
    Python
    Java
    C# (.NET)

This means:
    Backend teams can write E2E in same language
    Better integration in enterprise environments

Cypress Supports JavaScript / TypeScript only --> Great for frontend teams, limiting for others.


                            6️⃣ Event Loop Blocking: Real Flakiness Example
                            ----------------------------------------------

Note: Cypress can only retry assertions, not actions

Example:
    cy.get('#save').click()
    cy.get('.toast').should('be.visible')

If your app:
    blocks the event loop briefly
    re-renders slowly

Cypress:
    may miss the DOM change
    retries assertions but can’t retry the click
    leads to flaky tests

Playwright

    Runs externally:

    await page.click('#save');
    await page.waitForSelector('.toast');


    Browser rendering happens independently.
